                    <h3>Oak</h3>
                    <p>Oak is a timeless classic known for strength and durability, and is the least expensive option. It has a very distinct, open-grain pattern and takes any stain very well.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-5 sample-use">
                    <h4>Use</h4>
                    <p>Oak is resistant to scratches, stains, and dust, which means it requires less maintenance and cleaning.</p>

                    <h3>Brown Maple</h3>
                    <p>Brown maple has multiple colors in its grain—streaks of brown, tan, white, and cream make Brown Maple stand out from other woods. It is softer and smoother than oak, and when stained, looks similar to cherry. It takes color stains well, especially medium to dark stains, and its smooth surface is ideal for painted finishes.</p>

                <div class="col-md-5 sample-use">
                    <h4>Use</h4>

                    <h3>Cherry</h3>
                    <p>Cherry wood has a natural reddish hue with a warmth intensified by any of the cherry stains. It darkens as it ages, which adds even more depth to its rich color.  It is a bit softer than oak, but equal to Brown Maple in hardness. Cherry takes stain easily, has a circular grain pattern, and a satin-smooth feel.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-5 sample-use">
                    <h4>Use</h4>
                    <p>Cherry is an ideal choice for elegant dining furniture. (Sap Cherry is less expensive than Cherry, however this wood has white streaks. The streaks can be made less visible by choosing a dark stain color.)</p>

                    <h3>Rustic Cherry</h3>
                    <p>While Rustic Cherry comes from the same tree as standard Cherry, Rustic Cherry has knots, imperfections, and more distinct grain patterns and color variations in it.</p>

                    <h3>Quarter Sawn White Oak</h3>
                    <p>Quarter Sawn White Oak has a striking appearance, which is created by the way the oak trees are sawn at a 90-degree angle and then cut into quarters. This sawing method reveals dramatic flecks and rays throughout the wood, and displays the artistic texture of wood grain in a ‘stripey’ pattern. Quarter sawn white oak has a cooler white to sage undertone, and absorbs a variety of stains evenly.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-5 sample-use">
                    <h4>Use</h4>
                    <p>Quarter Sawn White Oak is extremely durable and even more resistant than oak. It is an ideal choice for mission and shaker style furniture. It is not recommended for painting as the coarse grain will show under some painted finishes.</p>

                <p>If you love the rugged look of rustic furniture, there are plenty of options for you. A few of our woods are available in both standard and rustic versions. In the standard woods, the imperfections are cut out, whereas in the rustic woods, there are more visible grain, knots, and imperfections. Priced lower than standard wood, rustic wood is preferable when going with a natural vibe. </p>

                </header>
                <p>Give your home a harmonious look by doing a stain match.<br/>Send us a drawer or door from a piece of furniture you are trying to match, and we will attempt to find a suitable stain match from the standard color choices. </p>
                
                <p>If we are unable to find a match, our finisher can do a custom mix of stain colors especially for you.<br/>The cost for a stain match is approximately $125.</p>
                <p>Please note: Our stain samples and stain matches serve as excellent approximations of the colors that will appear on your actual piece of furniture. However, due to natural grain variations in wood, we cannot guarantee, even with a stain match, that the sample color and the color of your finished product will appear identical.</p>
                <p></p>
                
                <p>For additional staining options, feel free to drop us a line at <span class="primary">866-450-WOOD (9663)</span>.</p>
