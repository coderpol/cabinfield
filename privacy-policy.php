                    <h4 class="heading">What type of PII does Cabinfield collect from you and how do we use it?</h4>

                    <p>Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by us. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of our Website, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of our Website.</p>
                    <p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose by posting personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through our Website, this information may be collected and used by others.</p>
                    <p>Cabinfield may provide your PII to individuals or entities who work on our behalf or with us. These individuals or entities may use your PII to help fulfill your requests and to help us communicate with you about different products, services or resources appearing on the Website.

                    <ol class="alpha">
                        <li>Device operations: information about the activities performed on your device, such as windows open while using our Website, or mouse movements.</li>
                        <li>Device attributes: information such as the operating system your device uses, hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage space, browser type, application and file names and types, and device plugins.</li>
                        <li>Identifiers: unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers that may be available from games, apps or accounts you use, and family device IDs (or other identifiers unique to our Products and services associated with the same device or account).</li>
                        <li>Device signals: Bluetooth signals, and information about nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons, and cell towers.</li>
                        <li>Data from device settings: information you allow us to receive through your device settings that you turn on, such as access to your global positioning system (“GPS”) location, camera or photos. If you decide not to turn on your GPS location function in your device you may not be able to use all the features in our Website.</li>
                        <li>Network and connections: information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other devices that are nearby or that operate on your network.</li>
                        <li>Cookie data: data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5 class="point">Automatically Collected Information</h5>
                    <p>Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Site, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features on our Website are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.</p>
                    <p>We may receive confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our Website and Products.</p>
                    <p>We may use this data to customize Content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Website – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Website, and we can use that knowledge to make the Website interesting to as many users as possible.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="point">Use of Cookies</h5>
                    <p>We may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
                    <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Cabinfield pages, or register with our Website, a cookie helps us recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to our Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Website features that you may have customized.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="point">Heat Map and Tracking Software</h5>
                    <p>We may use various types of tracking software (“<u>Tracking Software</u>”) to track mouse movement, scrolling, time spent on a page/screen, pages/screens visited, and clicks in order to better understand our users’ needs and to optimize the use of our Website. The most common form of Tracking Software is referred to as a “heat map” and the forms of heat maps include scroll maps, click maps, and movement maps. Heat maps are graphical representations of data where values are depicted by color. Users hereby specifically agree to our use of Tracking Software and heat maps.</p>
                    <p>Our Tracking Software may capture screenshots of users’ mouse movements, scrolling, and clicking habits which helps us understand what users want, care about, and do when using our Website by visually representing their clicks, taps and scrolling behavior. Some of the reasons why we use heat map software are as follows: to see if users are reaching important Content or failing to see it, to find and use a page’s main links, buttons, opt-ins, and calls to action (“CTAs”), to see if users are getting distracted by non-clickable elements, and to compare usage against mobile, tablet and desktop devices.</p>
                    <p>We use Tracking Software to help us better understand our users’ experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our Website with user feedback. This Tracking Software uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices. This includes a device's IP address (processed during your Website visit and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display our content. This Tracking Software stores this information on our behalf.</p>
                    <p>We may use social media pixels to track and collect general information about your use in compliance with different social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) for the purpose of promoting products, tracking conversions, remarketing, running target advertisements and so forth.</p>
                    <p>Third parties like Facebook may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect and receive information from our Website for the purpose of providing target advertisements. You may see our ads on Facebook after you have visited our Website.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="point">Site and Application Analytics</h5>
                    <p>We use multiple web analytics tools provided by service partners, including but not limited to, Google Analytics to collect information about how you interact with our Website, including what pages you visit, what site you visited prior to visiting our Website, how much time you spend on each page, what operating system and web browser you use and network and IP information. Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Website. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. We use the information provided by these tools to improve our Website usage. These tools place persistent cookies in your browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our Site. Each cookie cannot be used by anyone other than the service provider (example: Google for Google Analytics). The information collected from the cookie may be transmitted to and stored by these service partners on servers in a country other than the country in which you reside. Though information collected does not include personal data such as name, address, billing information, etc., the information collected is used and shared by these service providers in accordance with their individual privacy policies. You can control the technologies we use by utilizing settings in your browser or third-party tools.  You can opt-out of making your activity available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.

                    <h5 class="point">Targeted Advertisements</h5>
                    <p>Targeted ads or interest-based offers may be presented to you based on your activities on our Website. These offers will display as varying product banners presented to you while browsing. We may also partner with third parties to manage our advertising on our webpages.  Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about such activities in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests, and to measure advertising effectiveness.  If you are in the US or Canada and wish to opt out of interest-based advertising visit  <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com">http://preferences-mgr.truste.com</a>  If you are located in the European Union visit <a href="www.Youronlinechoices.eu">www.Youronlinechoices.eu</a>. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="point">Under what other circumstances may we release PII?</h5>
                    <p>In addition to sharing your PII with third parties as described above, we may also release your PII to other third parties if we believe that such release is necessary (a) to comply with the law (e.g., a legal process or a statutory authorization or requirement) or a court order, (b) in order to apply or enforce the Terms of Use, (c) to protect you, other Website users, or us from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the Website, or (d) if we reasonably believe that a danger to any person or property requires the disclosure of such PII or otherwise if we believe such a disclosure is needed to protect our interests (as determined by us in our sole discretion).</p>
                    <p>Our rights under this Privacy Policy may be automatically assigned by Cabinfield, in our sole discretion, to a third party or parties, and such an assignment will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns and/or licensees. Without limitation of the foregoing, we may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including without limitation your PII, with any company under our common control, joint venture, as well as to a potential acquirer and/or an acquirer (including without limitation in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets or stock, or in the event of bankruptcy). In each such instance, the PII we have collected from you may be one of the assets transferred in connection with such a transaction.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="point">Use of your Personal Information</h5>
                    <p>We collect and use your personal information to operate our Website.

                    <p>While Cabinfield does not, and will not ever, sell, rent or lease its user or customer lists to third parties, Cabinfield may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to assist us to provide our Products and services to you, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>
                    <p> We may share your information with vendors, business clients, and other third-party providers who are performing services for us. We may also use your information for internal record keeping and data analysis. For our statistical purposes, we gather details of user visits to our Website and the information that users access, including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, browser usage, page visits, weblogs, and other communication data. When you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We also use your information to ensure that content and the functionality of our Website is presented in the most effective manner for computer or mobile devices.</p>
                    <p>We may disclose information we collect from you to an affiliate or other third party in the event of any merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, reorganization, liquidation, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock.</p>
                    <p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These third-party advertising companies may use advertising technologies such as cookies, web beacons and other similar advertising technologies. These companies may use aggregated information about your visits to our Website or use of our services and third party sites in order to provide advertisements and promotions about our Products that we believe users may find of interest.</p>
                    <p>Cabinfield will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Cabinfield or the Website; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Cabinfield; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Cabinfield, or the public.</p>
                    <p>From time to time, personal  and business financial information (“Financial Information”) (including, but not limited to, banking information, credit card information, payment facilitator details, or other financial information) may be transmitted to facilitate transactions between you and us. We will never share such Financial Information with third parties other than those third parties such as payment facilitators, banks, processing gateways, financial intermediaries, and merchant processors required to process and facilitate the sending and receiving of payments, and you understand that we cannot control how these third parties will use such Financial Information to perform their services to facilitate payments.
