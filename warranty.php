                    <h3>Warranty </h3>
                </header>
                <p>Cabinfield products are crafted to provide enduring beauty and lasting quality. Cabinfield will completely cover costs for any defects in materials and/or workmanship (as determined by Cabinfield in its sole discretion), that occur within one year of purchase. This limited warranty applies to the original purchaser of our product. The warranty does not cover normal wear and tear, or the natural weathering of wood when exposed to the elements.</p>
                
                <h4 class="article-subtitle">Additional Warranty on Gazebos & Playhouses:</h4>
                <p>We warranty the wood and construction of our Gazebo & Playhouse products against damage from rot and/or termites - for as long as you live in your home. We reserve the right to remedy any defect that may occur in your product, and we will typically do that through our network of qualified independent contractors. To qualify for this additional warranty, you: (1) must have performed normal maintenance on the product, as determined by Cabinfield (and as provided in the Buyer's Guide, described below), and (2) must not use the product for commercial purposes or in a commercial establishment (unless you specifically purchased a Commercial Gazebo, in which case commercial use is expected and the additional warranty will apply). Some parts, such as roofing, have additional warranties from their manufacturer.</p>
                <p>As is the case with any wooden product, performance and beauty depends on how well you maintain and care for it. Please see our Buyer's Guide for suggested gazebo maintenance. The natural properties of wood include knots, minor cracks, splinters, and natural expansion and contraction of lumber depending upon temperature, environment, and natural grain traits. Adhering to our maintenance schedule will maximize the performance and beauty of your natural wooden gazebo. This warranty excludes damage due to ground settlement, modification, or any abnormal conditions out of our control.</p>
                <p>For those who wish to have a virtually maintenance-free gazebo experience, Cabinfield offers a number of high-quality, affordably priced vinyl gazebos. These gazebos require almost no maintenance and will last for many years to come. If you want to have the look of a gazebo but don't have the time to properly maintain fine wooden products, our vinyl option is the perfect solution. We provide a 10 year warranty on our vinyl gazebos against any material or manufacturing defects.</p>
